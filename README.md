# COTBK-Menu

### Adds sourcemod functionality to Castle Of The Bladekeeper  
### Please Note: This is not necessary to play the map, just some QoL features  
**Please add translations if you can via PR or send them to `tilgep#6294`**
- Use command `!commandsmenu` to access features  
- Upgrade your stats
- Cast your spells
- See your abilities
- Read the lore
- Allows loading VIP status without needing to retry
- Translate for each player (if language supported)
- Mapper approved & tested

Let me know about any bugs  
For use in version `_b2` and above  
Reloading during the map should be fine but requires a round restart as well  

### `v1.3`
- Fix some functions not checking if they should do anything  

### `v1.2`
- Update translations for abilities to show descriptions again
- Optimise lore menu (by storing the entity holding info rather than finding it every time)  

### `v1.1`
- Added translation support
- Added confirmation box to `Reset Points`
- Fixed an unsuccessful script find not notifying the map properly
- Optimisations to script finding
