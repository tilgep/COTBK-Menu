# COTBK-Menu

### Adds sourcemod functionality to Castle Of The Bladekeeper  
### Please Note: This is not necessary to play the map, just some QoL features
- Use command `!commandsmenu` to access features  
- Upgrade your stats
- Cast your spells
- See your abilities
- Read the lore
- Allows loading VIP status without needing to retry
- Mapper approved & tested

Let me know about any bugs  
Translation files can be added in the future  
For use in version `_b2` and above  
Reloading during the map should be fine but requires a round restart as well
